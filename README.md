## Hi there 👋 I am Irina Sevostyanova

I’m Data Analyst

🔭 I’m currently working on data analysis projects, including Power BI/ DataLens dashboards and business metrics analysis.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced statistical methods, machine learning, and improving my skills in SQL and Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn).
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting Data Analysis projects, data visualization, and working with datasets together.
🤔 I’m looking for help with optimizing complex SQL queries and best practices in MLOps.
💬 Ask me about SQL, data visualization, statistics fundamentals, and how to find insights in raw data.
📫 How to reach me: i.akhtareeva@gmail.com
⚡ Fun fact: My hobby is finding patterns not only in data but also in the history of art
